In this directory you can find perl scripts to collect latency histogram data from NetApp C-mode (version 8) filers
for visualization with PyLatencyMap
To get started see the provided example scripts, in particular Example10_NetApp_Cmode_reads.sh and Example10b_NetApp_Cmode_writes.sh

Note that the PERL scripts need additional modules, in particular Net::OpenSSH and IO::Pty. Some tips for installing PERL modules:
     - yum install perl-CPAN
     - download the modules from CPAN
