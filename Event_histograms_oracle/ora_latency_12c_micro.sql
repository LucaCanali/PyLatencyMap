-- ora_latency_12c_micro.sql
-- this is part of the PyLatencyMap package, by Luca.Canali@cern.ch 
-- service script used to extract data from gv$event_histogram_micro and print it in a record format 
-- to be processes by LatencyMap.py for visualization as Frequency-Intensity HeatMap
-- Dependency: wait_and_repeat.sql provides loop-like execution
--
-- Note this script does not work on Oracle versions prior to 12.1.0.2 as it uses a 12.1.0.2 new
-- feature/view: gv$event_histogram_micro
--
-- Usage: @ora_latency_12c_micro.sql <event_name> <wait_time_in_sec>
-- Examples: 
--           sqlplus -S / as sysdba @ora_latency_12c_micro "db file sequential read" 3
--           sqlplus -S / as sysdba @ora_latency_12c_micro "log file sync" 3
